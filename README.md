Notes App | JavaScript

This is a description of a notes application developed in the JavaScript programming language. The application is a web-based system that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. Users can view a list of notes displayed in a table format, including information about the creation time, note content, and note category. The note categories are predefined and include "Task," "Random Thought," and "Idea." The table of notes also includes a separate column displaying a list of dates mentioned within each note.

Users also have the option to archive notes that are no longer needed, and they can view archived notes or unarchive them. The application also provides a summary table that counts the number of notes in each category, both for active and archived notes. The summary table is updated whenever users perform actions on the notes.
